# Bot to scrape product

This is is simple bot to scrape for any product from Amazon (as for now, will be planning to add for other e-commerce sites as well).
This helped me to grab my Playstation 5 ❤️

# Usage
```
npm install
```
```
npm start "<amazon email>" "<amazon password>" "<product page>"
```
The product page example would be something like this `https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B08RFC9DRQ/ref=crt_ewc_title_huc_1?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=AT95IG9ONZD7S`

And voila!!!<br/>
Wait for it it land till the payment selection page<br/>
Continue manually the next process <br/>
